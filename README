This Emacs library enables the use of PicoLisp in the multi-language
programming framework Org-Babel
(http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/index.html).

PicoLisp is a minimal yet fascinating lisp dialect and a highly
productive application framework for web-based client-server
applications on top of object-oriented databases. A good way to learn
PicoLisp is to first read Paul Grahams essay "The hundred year
language" (http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html) and then study the
various documents and essays published in the PicoLisp wiki
(http://picolisp.com/5000/-2.html). PicoLisp is included in some
GNU/Linux Distributions, and can be downloaded here:
http://software-lab.de/down.html. It ships with a picolisp-mode and a
inferior-picolisp-mode for Emacs (to be found in the /lib/el/
directory).

Although it might seem more natural to use Emacs Lisp for most
Lisp-based programming tasks inside Org-Mode (http://orgmode.org/), an
Emacs library written in Emacs Lisp, PicoLisp has at least two
outstanding features that make it a valuable addition to Org-Babel:

PicoLisp _is_ an object-oriented database with a Prolog-based query
language implemented in PicoLisp (Pilog). Database objects are
first-class members of the language. 

PicoLisp is an extremely productive framework for the development
of interactive web-applications (on top of a database).
